### Personality Traits
The greatest thief in the multiverse, in his own mind.

A gifted mage with the hubris to match.

### Ideals
Loyalty, learning from mistakes, and the pursuit of knowledge.

### Bonds
Pursuit of the necromancer who destroyed my hometown.

### Flaws
Brash and impetuous. Not as competent as he imagines.

### Backstory
Dack is the "rogue" of Magic. He’s sly, charming and a slick thief... most of the time. He’s almost as well defined by how often he’s caught attempting to steal something as actually stealing it. Although he doesn’t like to admit it to himself, he’s got a strong sense of loyalty and his personal tragedy means he often throws himself in situations to protect people when he could just as easily get away.

His true power lies in Psychometry. This power allows him to have visions of an object after touching it, through which he discerns how magical objects work and learns important pieces of the history of those who’ve touched something. He uses this ability to aid in tracking down objects and people of interest, but more importantly to learn the spells behind powerful magical artifacts. This ability means that when he steals an object, he rarely needs to keep it, he’s only stealing it to learn it’s secrets.

Dack keeps a generally scruffy appearance along with a small goatee and long hair. He’s got an olive complexion, most likely from the pseudo-Italian nature of his home plane. Dack’s defining feature is that he has a red stain on his right hand that extends from his fingertips to his elbow. This stain is the result of a punishment he endured while thieving on another plane early in his career. He keeps this stain as a reminder to himself of what his selfishness and sloppiness cost him.

### Other Traits
False Identity
> Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues. .

Sneak Attack
> 1d6 extra damage on attack where you have advantage or another enemy of creature is within 5 ft. (use once/turn).

Thieves' Cant
> Convey secret messages hidden in normal conversation.
