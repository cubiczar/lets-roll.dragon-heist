## Effect

You touch an object and reach into it with your psychic power, allowing you to view glimpses of events that the object was directly involved in. The object can weigh no more than 25 lbs. When you use psychometry on an object, you can learn one thing pertaining to the object from the following list:

- The identity of the last three people to own or - otherwise possess the object.
- The object's place of origin.
- The face of the last person to use the object.
- The object's intended purpose.
- The object's age.
- The date of the object's last use.
- What the object was last used for.

After each use of psychometry on an object, make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose to use psychometry on the same object again without using a spell slot to recast it as long as you did not stop touching the object. On a failed save, you can not glean any more information from the object for 24 hours.

## At Higher Levels

Starting at 3rd level, The DC to repeat usage is lowered to a DC 10. At 6th level, you can learn up to 3 things pertaining to the object.
