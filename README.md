# Welcome to Dragon Heist

Welcome Adventurers, to the Waterdeep: Dragon Heist Play-By-Slack repository.

We are currently in the Character Building phase. We will have until the end of November to complete character generation. All characters need to be submitted to the channel as a file, unless we find a better way to manager character sheets. Perhaps a GitHub Gist or a Google doc?

On December 1st, we will begin play with Chapter 1: A Friend In Need.

Notice the Threads - I'd like to keep the channel devoted to Character voices, and threads for the player's voice.

## Characters

The campaign will be a city-based adventure full of intrigue. Waterdeep frowns upon openly worn weapons and armor, although at times, both will be needed. Build your characters appropriately. 

Rules from the following source books will be allowed:

 - The Player's Handbook
 - The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide
 
 Nobles, Guilds, and Factions will all be important. You can either start out from the beginning participating as/in one, or you can develop one along the way. If anyone is interested in Nobleship, Faction Membership, or Guild Membership, I can follow-up in a subsequent post with the available options.
